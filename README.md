# verilog_iterative_division
This module implements a 32-bit division method that significantly helps to save hardware resources. Compared to the / operator, this method uses five times less hardware resources. This comes at the expense of reduced speed: Depending on the inputs, this algorithm might take a significant amount of time to compute the quotient.
